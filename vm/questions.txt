	1. Is a frame table essentially just a list of the frames that are located in physical memory as shown in the graphic (show graphic)?

	2. Which replacement algorithm are we supposed to use, or is it up to us?

			a. Is clock, in your experience, relatively harder (or longer) to implement?

	3. Can we use an array of frames? If so, then how big does the array need to be?

	4. Should we prioritize space or time for this project?
