Questions about project:

process_wait / process.c
	Will we have to worry about race conditions when implementing process_wait()?
		no, not modifying any saved data. should be fine in this function
	Returning status?
		can be anything. there is no predefined list or enum to tell us what to pass. Our goal is only to pass what is sent in exit to process_execute and print it

process_execute / process.c
	should we parse both the fn_copy and filename in process.c?
		pass args to setup stack and parse there
		Dont have to parse both fn_copy and filename. Filename is used in thread_create to name the thread and that's it. 
		**always copy string before tokenizing it **
	how to pass args to start_process?
		leave cmdline alone and send it to load which calls setup_stack(). From there, we can pass it to setup_stack() and parse in setup_stack(). 

process.c functions
	how should we test these functions? use asserts, printf, etc?
		use backtrace and asserts, prints to see whats going on

setup_stack / process.c
	word_align??





syscall.c
	1. Best place to implement "access user memory"?
		create a function and call it in syscall_handler. **They'll take off points if we don't use a function and copy and paste the validating code multiple times
	2. Do we need to call the system calls ourselves or are they called from syscall_handler?
		system call functions are called from within syscall_handler after we get the system call number
	3. Are we supposed to eventually uncomment UNUSED? Should we access the stack in there using the interrupt frame? Does syscall_init ever get called or is it just a template used to base all our other calls on that?
		we are using the frame that is passed to us. UNUSED was just to get rid of the warning before we actually implemented this function
	4. Which pointer should we use to access args off the stack inside syscall_handler?
		esp that is in the bottom couple lines of the frame struct
	5. Use lookup_page() to verify pointer? should be NULL if the page doesn't exist because it hasn't been mapped. What is *PD(page directory)?
		lookup_page() will be used to validate the page. The PD argument is thread specific. The second argument is whatever pointer we're trying to dereference and want to check the validity of. 
	6. Are we verifying actual pointer to frame or frame pointer saved inside of frame?
		Verifying the pointer inside of frame

	***for each frame sent to use, we have to validate all of the data sent to us. this data changes depending on the system call that is being called***
