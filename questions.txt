Questions about project:

process_wait / process.c
	Will we have to worry about race conditions when implementing process_wait()?
		no, not modifying any saved data. should be fine in this function
	Returning status?
		can be anything. there is no predefined list or enum to tell us what to pass. Our goal is only to pass what is sent in exit to process_execute and print it

process_execute / process.c
	should we parse both the fn_copy and filename in process.c?
		pass args to setup stack and parse there
		Dont have to parse both fn_copy and filename. Filename is used in thread_create to name the thread and that's it. 
		**always copy string before tokenizing it **
	how to pass args to start_process?
		leave cmdline alone and send it to load which calls setup_stack(). From there, we can pass it to setup_stack() and parse in setup_stack(). 

process.c functions
	how should we test these functions? use asserts, printf, etc?
		use backtrace and asserts, prints to see whats going on

setup_stack / process.c
	word_align??

syscall.c / exit()
